<h1 style="font-size:280%; text-align: center;">About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Jasmin Diaz, born on January 8, 2002, seventeen years old. I was born and raised in Oahu, Hawaii. Both of my parents are 100% Mexican which means even though I look White, believe it or not, I am Mexican. I don't know how to speak Spanish, but I would like to one day.</p>
<p> I am the biggest weirdo and most awkward person you'll ever meet. People think I'm weird because I laugh at my own jokes and make up situations in my head. Whenever I go anywhere, I make eye contact with people and continue to stare them down until they look away first. I think it's funny but my friends think it's weird. Some of my friends say I laugh at everything and other friends say I'm the hardest person to make laugh.</p>


<p> My favorite animals are jellyfish and elephants. Jellyfish are cool because they glow in the ocean and don't have any bones. Elephants are awesome because they have big ears and grow tusks, which make them look cute. My favorite dessert is brownies.

<p> I love watching movies. I watch most film genres, but really enjoy watching drama and fantasy. My random page talks more about the movies I like, so go check it out!
<p> I am a senior at James Campbell High School. I had simple freshman and sophomore school years, but in my junior year I decided to spice things up and take AP Calculus. Surprisingly, I scored a 3 out of 5 on the End Of Course Exam and earned four college credits at UH West Oahu. AP Computer Science Principles is the only other AP class I have taken.</p>
<p> After high school I want to go to college at UH West Oahu and earn a bachelor's degree. I want to major in Social Work and become a Social Worker.</p>
