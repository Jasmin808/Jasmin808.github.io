<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Jasmin Diaz, born on January 8, 2002, seventeen years old. I was born and raised in Oahu, Hawaii. Both of my parents are 100% Mexican which means even though I look White, believe it or not, I am Mexican. I don't know how to speak Spanish, but I would like to one day.</p>
<p> I am the biggest weirdo you'll ever meet. My friends think I am weird. my family thinks I am weird, and I know that I am weird. I like to make up situations in my head and say them out loud. People think I'm weird for that because I laugh at my own joke. I am also the most awkward person you'll ever meet. I turn the smallest situation into the most awkward situation. My family and freinds say I have a staring problem. Whenever I'm walking, I make eye contact with people by accident but continue to stare them down until they look away first. I think it's funny but people think it's weird. Some of my friends say I laugh at everything and other friends say I'm the hardest person to make laugh.</p>
<p> I love watching movies. I watch most film genres, but really enjoy watching drama and fantasy. My random page talks more about the movies I like, so go check it out!
<p> I am a senior at James Campbell High School. I had simple freshman and sophomore school years, but in my junior year I decided to spice things up and take AP Calculus. Surprisingly, I scored a 3 out of 5 on the End Of Course Exam and earned four college credits at UH West Oahu. AP Computer Science Principles is the only other AP class I have taken.</p>
<p> After high school I want to go to college at UH West Oahu and earn a bachelor's degree. I want to major in Social Work and become a Social Worker.</p>
